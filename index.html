                            <p>My name is Eric Finney. I am an aspiring web developer. As a contracting professional, I've supported
                                several EPA clients and Army clients. I've had experience coding in a client-server environment
                                as a Sybase PowerBuilder developer. I currently work as a Microsoft SharePoint administrator
                                supporting the army. This requires me to work on the client site where pop ins from the client
                                happen on a regular basis, which is great unless you need your own quiet space to get work
                                done. Working as a developer gives you the ability to work off site with your team or by
                                yourself.
                            </p>
                            <p> I am a long suffering Redskins fan, but am old enough to have witnessed their three superbowls
                                wins. Always hopeful, but have had my faith tested thanks to the troll who bought the team
                                in the 90s. I also like the Nats and DC United and can't believe our dumb luck in acquiring
                                Wayne Rooney. I also like to travel and fish with friends and family. I have two kids in
                                college which means I'm broke, happily sending my money to help my kids figure out their
                                lives. </p>
